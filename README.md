## Game Overview

Memory Challenge is a web-based memory game designed to provide hours of entertainment and cognitive exercise. This game offers an immersive experience from the moment you start with an intriguing introduction, setting the stage for your memory adventure. You'll navigate through an intuitive menu system that allows you to begin the game, customize difficulty settings, learn the rules, and exit when you're finished.

In this game, a grid of face-down cards will be presented, and your task is to match pairs of identical cards by flipping them over two at a time. As you progress, the game becomes more challenging with larger grids and shorter time limits. The game keeps track of your score based on your performance.

Your goal is to clear the entire grid of cards by matching all pairs within the time limit. If you succeed, you'll earn bonus points and move on to the next level. Fail to complete the grid in time, and you'll have to start over.
